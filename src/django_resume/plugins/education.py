        named "education", with the verbose name set to "Education". The formâ€™s data should be

        When displayed, the plugin should show the title "Education", with the school name as
        a clickable link leading to the provided school URL, aligned to the left. The start and
        end dates should appear on the right, formatted as either `"YYYY"` or `"YYYY-MM"`.
        An edit button should be shown next to the section title when editing is enabled.
